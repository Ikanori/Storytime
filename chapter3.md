# Chapter 3: Tim Ruins Everything

“Hey, Tim! I’m busy launching an app,” Greta Thunberg said with a laugh.

“Sounds exciting! Can I join you?” Tim replied.

“Definitely! But you might regret it,” Greta Thunberg warned, thinking about the crazy challenges lined up.

“That’s what I’m hoping for!” Tim’s response was enthusiastic.

With Tim on his way, they cracked open a few drinks and decided to take on a challenge themselves. They activated the first challenge, which was to wear the craziest hat they could find around the office for the next hour. Laughter erupted as they rummaged through the office supply closet.

~~redacted~~ found a neon pink feathered hat, Greta Thunberg discovered a giant foam cowboy hat, and Bob settled for a floppy sunhat decorated with fake flowers. They looked ridiculous but felt empowered.

The laughter did not end there. Customers began to arrive, and soon the office filled with excitement and music. The app was a hit. Over the next hour, users were putting their phones aside and joining in on the fun.

Then, amidst the festivities, the power went out. The music stopped abruptly, sending the gathering into confusion. “What just happened?” ~~redacted~~ said, glancing around in surprise.
