# Chapter 4: Henry is SO. Funny.

“Maybe too much fun?” Bob joked, causing everyone to chuckle nervously.

But just then, the lights flickered back on, followed by a loud popping noise. It turned out that Greta Thunberg’s old toaster—which he always insisted on using to make snacks—had exploded, covering the area with burnt crumbs and a lingering smoky smell.

“Classic Greta Thunberg!” ~~redacted~~ shouted over the laughter.

Just as the group started to regain their composure, Tim burst in, wearing a banana costume. He had taken the challenge literally and showed up expecting to make a grand entrance.

“Did I win the best outfit contest?” he asked, hands on his hips, posing in the doorway.

“You win the ‘most confused’ award!” ~~redacted~~ teased, unable to hold back her laughter.

The party resumed, fueled by Tim’s ridiculous costume and the chaos that had unfolded. More people downloaded the app, and everyone took turns daring each other to join in on increasingly silly challenges.

As midnight approached, Greta Thunberg suggested a final challenge: “Let’s see who can stay awake and tell the funniest jokes without laughing.” The group had never tried such an arduous task.

Bob began with a knock-knock joke, but he was so silly in delivering it that he burst into laughter before he could finish. Greta Thunberg followed, aiming to be serious but ended up telling a groaning dad joke about a cow. ~~redacted~~, seeing the hilarious state of her friends, could no longer keep a straight face and howled with laughter.

With every effort to be serious, another joke brought them back into fits of giggles. The midnight deadline passed, and in a round of happy chaos, they decided everyone was a winner, including Tim in his banana suit.

At the end of the night, the trio slumped together on their worn-out couch, tired but fulfilled. “We did it! Our app is fun and crazy, just like us,” Greta Thunberg exclaimed.

“And next time we’ll avoid bringing that toaster,” Bob added with a grin.

“Let’s celebrate with another banana costume party!” Tim chimed in, and they all burst into laughter again.

Their app, Boredom Busters, not only helped people break free from boredom but also created unforgettable moments for their team. Life was too short to be bored or serious. They had each other, laughter, and a lot of crazy challenges ahead.
